# SQL Practice with Covid Data

Worked on my SQL skills and started a project for my portfolio.
I chose my data as real Covid numbers from all over the world. You may check https://ourworldindata.org for many other datasets and graphs.

In this project in addition to basic select functions, I learned Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.

I created my queries as follows;
* Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
* Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
* Percentage of Population that has received at least one Covid Vaccine
